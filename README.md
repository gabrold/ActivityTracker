## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### 1. User Authentication & Setup
- Users log in using their Google account through OAuth2 authentication
- Upon login, users select their team from a predefined list
- The extension maintains session state and remembers user preferences

### 2. Activity Tracking Process
- Activities are loaded dynamically from a centralized Google Sheets database
- Users can increment counters for different activities throughout their workday
- All activity data is stored locally in Chrome's storage for immediate access
- Running totals are maintained to show cumulative daily progress

### 3. Data Synchronization
- **Automatic Sync**: Every 15 minutes, the extension automatically uploads activity data to Google Sheets
- **Data Persistence**: Local data is cleared after successful sync to prevent duplication
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures data integrity during sync failures
- **Manual Sync**: Users can monitor sync status and timing through the interface

### 4. Data Storage Structure
- **Local Storage**: Temporary activity counts stored with user email and date keys
- **Google Sheets**: Permanent storage with columns for timestamp, user email, activity name, and count
- **Team Context**: All data is associated with the user's selected team for organizational clarity

## ðŸ”’ Data Security & Privacy

### Data Collection & Usage
The Activity Tracker extension is designed with privacy and security as top priorities:

#### What Data We Collect:
- **User Email**: Retrieved from Google OAuth for user identification and data association
- **Activity Counts**: Numerical counts of work activities performed by the user
- **Team Assignment**: User's selected team for organizational context
- **Timestamps**: When activities were logged for temporal analysis
- **Theme Preferences**: User interface customization choices

#### What Data We DON'T Collect:
- **No Browsing History**: The extension does not track or record websites visited
- **No Personal Content**: No access to emails, documents, or personal files
- **No Keystroke Logging**: No monitoring of typing or keyboard activity
- **No Screen Recording**: No screenshots or screen monitoring capabilities

### Security Measures

#### Authentication Security:

- **Revocation Support**: Complete token revocation on logout for security

#### Data Protection:
- **HTTPS Only**: All API communications use encrypted HTTPS connections
- **Minimal Permissions**: Extension requests only necessary permissions for functionality
- **Local Data Encryption**: Chrome's built-in storage encryption protects local data
- **No Third-party Tracking**: No external analytics or tracking services

#### Access Controls:
- **User-specific Data**: Each user can only access their own activity data
- **Team-based Segregation**: Data is organized by team for appropriate access control
- **Session Management**: Automatic logout and data clearing capabilities

### Data Storage & Retention

#### Local Storage (Chrome Extension):
- **Temporary Nature**: Local data is automatically cleared after successful sync
