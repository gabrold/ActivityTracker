- **Data Persistence**: Local data is cleared after successful sync to prevent duplication
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures data integrity during sync failures
- **Manual Sync**: Users can monitor sync status and timing through the interface

### 4. Data Storage Structure
- **Local Storage**: Temporary activity counts stored with user email and date keys
- **Google Sheets**: Permanent storage with columns for timestamp, user email, activity name, and count
- **Team Context**: All data is associated with the user's selected team for organizational clarity

## ðŸ”’ Data Security & Privacy

### Data Collection & Usage
The Activity Tracker extension is designed with privacy and security as top priorities:
